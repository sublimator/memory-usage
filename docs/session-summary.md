# Session Summary: Memory Monitor Refactoring

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Modularized the Codebase
Created a clean, modular structure with dependency injection:
- **managers/** - State, process, and websocket management
- **services/** - Business logic layer
- **models/** - Separated all Pydantic models
- **utils/** - Parsing and formatting helpers
- **ui/components/** - Reusable UI widgets
- **container.py** - DI container configuration

### 2. Fixed Key Issues
- ✅ Restored `--list` command functionality
- ✅ Eliminated circular imports
- ✅ Created proper state management with observer pattern
- ✅ Set up dependency injection framework

### 3. Created Documentation
- `next-steps.md` - What needs to be done
- `repo-overview.md` - How everything fits together
- `migration-guide.md` - How to fix the monitoring
- `session-summary.md` - This file

## What's Still Broken

### Critical Issue: MonitoringService is a Stub!
The main problem is that `services/monitoring_service.py` doesn't actually do anything:
```python
def _initialize_binary_result(self, binary_path: str, binary_name: str):
    """Initialize result tracking for current binary"""
    # Implementation similar to original
    pass  # <-- IT'S JUST PASS!
```

Meanwhile, `monitoring.py` has 1000+ lines of working code that needs to be integrated.

### Other Issues
1. **No process output** - Dashboard bottom panel stays empty
2. **No state updates** - Status bar never changes
3. **Can't copy logs** - RichLog needs selection support
4. **WebSocket disconnected** - Not properly integrated

## Time Spent

### What Took Time
- **Initial refactoring** (~30 min) - Created modular structure
- **Dependency injection** (~20 min) - Set up container and wiring
- **Debugging pydantic issue** (~10 min) - Fixed BaseSettings vs dataclass
- **Documentation** (~15 min) - Created comprehensive docs

### What Was Wasted
- **Deleted working code** - Removed the main() function that had asyncio logic
- **Created stubs** - MonitoringService doesn't actually work
- **Moving code around** - Some functionality was lost in translation

## Lessons Learned

1. **Don't delete working code** until replacement is tested
2. **Incremental refactoring** is better than big bang
3. **Test as you go** instead of refactoring everything first
4. **Stubs are dangerous** - Easy to forget to implement

## For Next Session

The main task is simple:
1. Open `services/monitoring_service.py`
2. Import `MemoryMonitor` from `monitoring.py`
3. Use it instead of the stub implementation
4. Hook up state updates to flow through `StateManager`

See `migration-guide.md` for the exact code needed.

## Architecture Benefits

Despite the issues, the new architecture is much better:
- **No globals** - Everything injected
- **Testable** - Easy to mock dependencies
- **Observable** - UI updates automatically
- **Modular** - Clear separation of concerns
- **Extensible** - Easy to add features

The foundation is solid, just needs the monitoring logic connected.
